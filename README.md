## This is my learning project. The goal is to build a web API with RESTful services.
Full focus on the backend for now, but I might do some frontend separately when the project is done.

To learn, I will read the book "Ultimate ASP.NET Core Web API" by Marinko Spasojevic and Vladimir Pecanac.

As I'm going through the content of the book, I will implement whatever there is to implement (to get a good grip of the subject and actually memorize the concepts).
